- [x] Add "TELEGRAM_BOT_NAME" to .env
- [x] Add "DOMAIN" to .env
- [x] Don't create duplicates in users collection

- Consider Reddit API timezone when displaying dates and timestamps
- Perhaps add a note about https://www.reddit.com/reddits/ in the welcome message
- Include an edit link in the actual digest
- Ask a follow-up question for the id if /subscribe is "empty"
- Add validation for creating and updating a digest
- Somehow disable scheduling bailouts in development
- Provide some more information about the digest schedule when subscribing
