# Done

- [x] Firebase for persistance
- [x] Unsubscribe in the bot
- [x] Update a digest, how without auth?
- [x] Add "TELEGRAM_BOT_NAME" to .env
- [x] Add "DOMAIN" to .env
- [x] Don't create duplicates in users collection
- [x] There shouldn't be a need for manually adding digests with the login in place
- [x] Login with telegram in the editor, no need to subscribe to things?
  - [x] Add auth to creating and updating digests

# Next Action

1. Mixpanel (https://mixpanel.com/pricing)
2. Add "Run now" to digest list

# Backlog

- Consider Reddit API timezone when displaying dates and timestamps
- Perhaps add a note about https://www.reddit.com/reddits/ in the welcome message
- Include an edit link in the actual digest
- Add validation for creating and updating a digest
- Somehow disable scheduling bailouts in development
- Provide some more information about the digest schedule when subscribing
